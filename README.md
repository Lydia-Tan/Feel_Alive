    vig·or·ous 
    /ˈviɡ(ə)rəs/
    adjective
    
    strong, healthy, and full of energy.

## Background
Tasked to create an art piece given the word: "vigorous," I am working on an installation centered around the a time in someone's life when they felt most lively, "healthy, and full of energy."

## Process
I tinkered with a few cheesy questions:
- "What makes you feel alive?"
- "Who makes you feel alive?"
- "When do you feel alive?"

Rather than picking one of the questions, instead I prompt users to finish the sentence themself:
- "[_____] makes me feel alive"

## Next steps
These responses will then be printed and implemented in an exhibit for my final project, displayed in the Duderstadt on April 25th, 2022. Do submit your own response -- anything goes :))
